# Basic PySpark project for Databricks job

A simple PySpark template for a wheel task creation in Databricks Jobs

Intended for Databricks Runtime 12.2 LTS, i.e. python 3.9.5, spark 3.3.2.

Note. PySpark version in the project must match Spark version in the env
(for PyCharm provide SPARK_HOME env var in the run configuration).

For testing `chispa` helper library is used 
(just because it's gotten the most number of stars on Github - https://github.com/MrPowers/chispa)
